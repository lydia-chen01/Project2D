# Project2D
This is my submission for BIMM143 Project 2D.
To run the code, the following files are needed:

1. The R Notebook
2. FOXO3_species.fasta - a fasta file containing the amino acid sequences for human, mouse, pig, and chimpanzee FOXO3, used for multiple sequence alignment.
3. 2UZK.pdb - the PDB file for human FOXO3 DNA binding domain that was downloaded directly from the PDB database (accession code 2UZK), used for homology modeling and 3D protein measurements.
4. mouse_FOXO3.pdb, pig_FOXO3.pdb, and chimpanzee_FOXO3.pdb - the PDB files for mouse, pig, and chimpanzee FOXO3 DNA binding domain that were downloaded after modeling was done using SWISS-MODEL, used for homology modeling and 3D protein measurements.

All files have been uploaded. 
How the fasta file was created: I searched the Uniprot database for FOXO3 and added the FASTA sequences for human, mouse, pig, and chimpanzee to basket. I then selected them all and downloaded them together into a single fasta file.

## Note
I also added the two images that I embedded in my R Notebook, in case they are unable to be viewed in the HTML. It worked for me, but when I downloaded the HTML directly from Github, I could no longer view the images. 
pymol_four.png refers to the PyMol image of the four structures modeled on top of each other in the homology modeling section.
FOXO3msa.png refers to the image of the sequence logo.
