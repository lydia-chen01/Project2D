# Project2D
This is my submission for BIMM143 Project 2D.
To run the code, the following files are needed:

1. The R Notebook
2. FOXO3_species.fasta - a fasta file containing the amino acid sequences for human, mouse, pig, and chimpanzee FOXO3, used for multiple sequence alignment.
3. 2UZK.pdb - the PDB file for human FOXO3 DNA binding domain that was downloaded directly from the PDB database (accession code 2UZK), used for homology modeling and 3D protein measurements.
4. mouse_FOXO3.pdb, pig_FOXO3.pdb, and chimpanzee_FOXO3.pdb - the PDB files for mouse, pig, and chimpanzee FOXO3 DNA binding domain that were downloaded after modeling was done using SWISS-MODEL, used for homology modeling and 3D protein measurements.

All files have been uploaded. 
How the fasta file was created: I searched the Uniprot database for FOXO3 and added the FASTA sequences for human, mouse, pig, and chimpanzee to basket. I then selected them all and downloaded them together into a single fasta file.
